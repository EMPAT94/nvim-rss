# nvim-rss

A simple rss reader for neovim written in lua.

## Project Goals

I aim for it to be similar to the excellent [vnews](https://github.com/danchoi/vnews) and, if you squint hard enough while looking sideways, then perhaps [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed).

Ideally, if you have a bunch of feeds and wish to simply view them in neovim instead of browsers or dedicated apps, then this plugin should help you out.

## Pre-requisites

TODO: Add links, versions and descriptions

1. neovim-0.5
2. curl
3. sqlite3
4. feed-parser (from luarocks) (depends on expat)
5. sqlite.lua (from luarocks) (depends on luv)

## Installing

Will update when I have a working minimal setup.

## Current Progress and Todos

- [x] Fetch & parse feeds
- [x] Setup a database
- [ ] Update UI for new feed data
- [ ] Add user interaction to RSS View
- [ ] Release v0.1 (Deadline : 13th Oct 2021)

## Personal Goals 

1. Learn lua (I plan to make a few more plugins!)
2. Learn how to make a neovim plugin
3. Contribute to the awesome neovim ecosystem
4. Share some opensource love <3
